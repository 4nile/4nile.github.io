And so this is the first post of this blog of what we call in French *veille littéraire*. You can find some of the journal RSS feed I am following [on my website](https://sites.google.com/view/elina-gilbert/useful-links?authuser=2).

<h1>Rheology of Soft Solid/Liquid Composites</h1>
My second paper is finally published! After almost two years of work, including six intense months of rereading and correcting the theory based on the wonderful insights of our referees (for real, referees can be harsh, but when they give you the tools to make better science and you do progress in your understanding, it feels amazing) we have a work I am extremely proud of studying in the details the mechanical dissipation properties of the solid emulsions I worked on during my PhD.

<h1>In the literature last week</h1>
<h2>ArXiv fights scientific malpractices by banning compsci reviews</h2>

In a context of [intense paper-milling and young research often self-citing to increase their indexation](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-04006-9) caused partially by the hyper-competitive industry that is academic research (a sentence that would be an oxymoron if not for the current grant-based system), arXiv moderators in the field of computer sciences have noticed a proliferation of so-called reviews that end up being bibliographical lists with not much added content from the author, no annotation or explanation of the link between the cited papers. Suspecting citation purchase and untraceable plagiarism caused by AIs, they have chosen to forbid the submission of reviews.

<h2>Mechanical non-reciprocity programmed by shear jamming in soft composite solids </h2>

By pre-shearing a suspendion of polystyrene beads in PDMS before crosslinking the continuous phase, the authors have created an easy programmable shear-jammed soft solid. The pre-shear aligns the beads in a given configuration, which results in an anisotropic response.
