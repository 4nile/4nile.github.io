And so this is the first post of this blog of what we call in French *veille littéraire*. You can find some of the journal RSS feed I am following [on my website](https://sites.google.com/view/elina-gilbert/useful-links?authuser=2).

<h1>Rheology of Soft Solid/Liquid Composites</h1>
My second paper is finally published! After almost two years of work, including six intense months of rereading and correcting the theory based on the wonderful insights of our referees (for real, referees can be harsh, but when they give you the tools to make better science and you do progress in your understanding, it feels amazing) we have a work I am extremely proud of studying in the details the mechanical dissipation properties of the solid emulsions I worked on during my PhD.

<h2>ArXiv fights scientific malpractices by banning compsci reviews</h2>

In a context of [intense paper-milling and young research often self-citing to increase their indexation](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-04006-9) caused partially by the hyper-competitive industry that is academic research (a sentence that would be an oxymoron if not for the current grant-based system), arXiv moderators in the field of computer sciences have noticed a proliferation of so-called reviews that end up being bibliographical lists with not much added content from the author, no annotation or explanation of the link between the cited papers. Suspecting citation purchase and untraceable plagiarism caused by AIs, they have chosen to forbid the submission of reviews.

<h2>Ghostwriting for private companies and its consequences on the trustworthiness of research</h2>

Glyphosates are a well-known scientific scandal in France, with still heavy debates as to whether or not they are truly dangerous for health. Orsekes and co-authors studied the impact of a paper that was recently revealed to have been ghostwritten for Monsanto with no independently acquired data, and showed that its influence was huge over the press and public opinion. Another example is studies by British pharmaceutical companies, which are heavily ghostwritten, with sometimes dramatic consequences such as avoidable deaths being caused by critical data being hidden by the brands to the researchers. The issue of ghostwriting however seems to be largely underestimated by the scientific community, whereas it drives a deep distrust from the general population, leading to an ever increased influence of pseudo-sciences and a rise of the anti intellectual sentiment.

<h2>Mechanical non-reciprocity programmed by shear jamming in soft composite solids </h2>

![Schematic of the sample generation and anisotropic behavior.](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41563-025-02407-3/MediaObjects/41563_2025_2407_Fig1_HTML.png?as=webp)

By pre-shearing a suspendion of polystyrene beads in PDMS before crosslinking the continuous phase, the authors have created an easy programmable shear-jammed soft solid. The pre-shear aligns the beads in a given configuration, which results in an anisotropic response. Once the behavior well-understood, with a phase diagram defined from the volume fraction and shear-stress applied to the material, various fun applications can be imagined.

<h2>Microscopic Euler beam</h2>

Using laser tweezers, microscopic particles can be arranged in tiny beams. When holding one end of these beams, the other end starts oscillating slowly. The authors have performed microscale mechanical testing to obtain the quadratic moment of the tiny structures.
