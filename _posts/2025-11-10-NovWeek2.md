And so this is the first post of this blog of what we call in French *veille littéraire*. You can find some of the journal RSS feed I am following [on my website](https://sites.google.com/view/elina-gilbert/useful-links?authuser=2).

<h1>Rheology of Soft Solid/Liquid Composites</h1>
My second paper is finally published! After almost two years of work, including six intense months of rereading and correcting the theory based on the wonderful insights of our referees (for real, referees can be harsh, but when they give you the tools to make better science and when you do progress in your understanding, it feels amazing) we have a work I am extremely proud of studying in the details the mechanical dissipation properties of the solid emulsions I worked on during my PhD.

<h2>ArXiv fights scientific malpractices by banning compsci reviews</h2>

In a context of [intense paper-milling and young research often self-citing to increase their indexation](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-04006-9) caused partially by the hyper-competitive industry that is academic research (a sentence that would be an oxymoron if not for the current grant-based system), arXiv moderators in the field of computer sciences have noticed a proliferation of so-called reviews that end up being bibliographical lists with not much added content from the author, no annotation or explanation of the link between the cited papers. Suspecting citation purchase and untraceable plagiarism caused by AIs, they have chosen to forbid the submission of reviews. Conversely, in parallel a [first ever conference has been organized with abstract and review performed only by AIs](https://www.science.org/content/article/futuristic-meeting-ais-took-lead-producing-and-reviewing-all-studies). Hopefully, this conference can lead to acknowledge in details the limitations of these tools, the first one in the question of reviewing being that LLMs tend to be programmed to be pleasing and access requests, making them mediocre critics of a paper's quality.

<h2>Ghostwriting for private companies and its consequences on the trustworthiness of research</h2>

Glyphosates are a well-known scientific scandal in France, with still heavy debates as to whether or not they are truly dangerous for health. Orsekes and co-authors studied the impact of a paper that was recently revealed to have been ghostwritten for Monsanto with no independently acquired data, and showed that its influence was huge over the press and public opinion. Another example is studies by British pharmaceutical companies, which are heavily ghostwritten, with sometimes dramatic consequences such as avoidable deaths being caused by critical data being hidden by the brands to the researchers. The issue of ghostwriting however seems to be largely underestimated by the scientific community, whereas it drives a deep distrust from the general population, leading to an ever increased influence of pseudo-sciences and a rise of the anti intellectual sentiment.

      <p>By pre-shearing a suspension of polystyrene beads in PDMS before crosslinking the continuous phase, the authors have created an easy programmable shear-jammed soft solid. The pre-shear aligns the beads in a given configuration, which results in an anisotropic response. Once the behavior well-understood, with a phase diagram defined from the volume fraction and shear-stress applied to the material, various fun applications can be imagined.</p>

      <p>The authors show that the rules leading to organization of particles in confinment are simpler than originally thought, and establish formal equivalences between different systems, using the competition betwee, repulsive forces and confining interactions. While experiemental validation seems to hold inthe 2D case, the authors have not yet validated their model in 3D systems. Still, their model shows and equivalence between packing of bubbles, hard spheres, and suspended magnets as model systems for repulsive particles.</p>

      <p>The authors use both method of biobased materials, i.e. imitating biological structures and processes, and using biologically-based materials from natural structures, to generate textured fabric films.
Their process consists essentially in molding a silk gel on pollen grains to obtain a pollen-imprinted surface which has multiple programmable functionnalities including wettability, optical properties, and of course is bio-degradable and recyclable.</p>

<h2>Shear-induced bubble nucleation in magmas</h2>

An experiement is developed to model the bubble nucleation in magma below volcanoes, using PEO. The nucleation of a first bubble creates a mechanical shock leading to a homogeneous nucleation cascade. The conclusion of the paper is that shear-induced nucleation can happen at much lower Poiseuille number than expected.

<h2>When, How, and Why Curing Conditions Change the Mechanical Properties of Silica-Free Silicone Elastomers</h2>

      <p>Everyone who has used commercial silicone elastomer such as Sylgards knows that the curing condition influence their mechanical properties, sometimes in an obscure way. The authors study the swelling and curing of silicones, with attention to curing temperatures and time, and performed differente characterizations to study the hydrosilylation between crosslinkers. It turns out that the cross-linking density is unchanged by the curing temperature, but rather it is the aggregation of resins filling the polymer network in large and rigid "grains" that increases the stiffness and toughness of those elastomers.</p>
