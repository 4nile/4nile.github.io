Once again, mostly opinion bills this week. There were a couple of interesting papers but I don't dare yet try to sum up something fully out of my field, which is why I did not include [this wonderful Nature paper on condutcion bands in amorphous materials](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-025-03099-x#Sec4).

<h1>In the literature last week</h1>
<h2>A fascinating take on the upcoming AI bubble crash</h2>
[link](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03776-0){:.button.button--primary.button--pill}

It has taken several years, but [financial analysts are finally recognizing the AI boom as a bubble about to burst](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-bubble-will-burst/), after half a decade of skyrocketing investments [going now in what is essentially a closed loop](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/openai-nvidia-amd-deals-risks-rcna234806). This investment pushed NVIDIA, which creates the processors used to power AIs, to a net value greater than the worth of every single nation in the world except for the USA, Germany and China. In other words, the burst will have atomic effects across the global economy, in scales which are so large they're hard to even evaluate at the moment.

In this context, Nature is interested in what effects the bubble bursting will have on number of publications. While the authors think the AI crash might lead to more students and academic researchers, following the trends of the crash of the dot com bubble in 2002-2004, they seem to be forgetting the _slight_ [increase of higer education](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/5270bffa-c68e-44f0-ac08-693485083747/the-college-affordability-crisis-in-america.pdf) and [housing costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_crisis_in_the_United_States), as well as [the current "college collapse" happening in the USA](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8v336lyz4o).

One thing is certain of the consequences of this burst, in an already extremely polarized economy: it will leave many people and many institutions without any money. How this upcoming dramatic increase in extreme poverty is dealt with by public authorities will shape the near future politics and economics.

<h2>Coming soon: the torment nexus from the famous tabletop game <i>Do not build the torment nexus</i></h2>

As research on brain-computer interfaces (BCI) evolves rapidly, so do companies selling neurotech. The ever increasing tech leads to drastic improvement of data anlysis, the data being brain waves. However as academically developed BCIs seem to have passed the threshold of registering preconscious thoughts, the question of control and rights over personal data (your thoughts, here) is evermore burning. As these tools can still represent a fantastic increase in uality of life for many people, even privately developed brain implants are seeing a surge of volunteers, who, to say the least, [are not treated with transparency](https://thedreydossier.substack.com/p/who-tf-is-in-my-head-part-4-where).

<h2>Introducing the j-metric: a true measure of what matters in academia</h2>

![The XKCD panel about standard proliferation](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png)

_This is a satirical paper._ Inspired maybe, by the most delicious looking chicken parm in cooking game show history, the author proposes a new metric to capture the quality of work of a researcher, which is the annual density of published work:

`j-index = weight of published work / time since graduation in years`

This raises with a humor a well-known concern: that evaluating every scientific production with some index (and there are enough to choose from! h-index, g-index, composite index, eigenfactor, and of course maybe the most important in the era of information, the k-index) might actually be impacting negatively the quality and trustworthiness of research.

<h2>Most researchers are not taught to write well</h2>
[link](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v18/186){:.button.button--primary.button--pill}

A scientist is a professional writer and public speaker, and yet most of us are either self-taught or got only feedback from our mentors. There is a stark need for better training, to be able to face constructive criticism and be more independent of numeric aids, which as convenient as they are, flatten the style differences and the voices between researchers. Keep on the lookout for [Briley Lewis](http://www.briley-lewis.com/science-writing-education.html)! she is working on developing some simple guidelines and helping tools to improve. And in the meantime, you can check out [writing in the sciences](https://writinginthesciences.uoguelph.ca/), which seems to have helpful modules.

      <p>At the tip of a wedge, mechanical stress accumulates in a way that is well described by LEFM. The wedge-tip strain and stress fields are much less understood in soft material, whose framework implies the study of large deformation and nonlinear constitutive equations. Various asymptotic analyses have already been performed, here the authors propose to study bi-material wedge tips. In their models, the stress concentration depends on the wedge angle and the ratio of shear moduli between the two materials, such that for all wedge angles below 180°, the singularity decreases when the A/B ratio increases, whereas at a flat angle, the singularity is undisturbed by the moduli ratio.</p>

<h2>Cyberattacks' harm to universities is growing — and so are their effects on research</h2>
[link](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03484-9){:.button.button--primary.button--pill}

Universities and research institutions worldwide are facing an ever increasing wave of cyberattacks with ransomware, which can paralyze them for months at a time. With the quantity of intellectual roperty produced, and the readily available private information of cohorts of thousands of students, researchers and other staff, they make for privileged targets. The largest the cohort, [the more massive the attacks](https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/indian-universities-face-record-8-487-weekly-cyberattacks-student-data-sold-on-dark-web-report-11758533665029.html). Research centers are preparing to face ransomware beyond just prevention to their staff, but from experience I can say that researchers and students need to get better at cybersafety, or at least need to stop putting critical and personal information on computers they used on an unsecured network, and need to save stuff locally more systematically.
