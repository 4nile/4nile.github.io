I may or may not have forgotten about this blog for a while and gotten a bit overwhelmed with the amount of papers to read when I got back to it, oops.

<h2>News and opinion pieces</h2>
<h3>Another huge blow to trust in science and medicine with a tampered Alzheimer's drug clinical trial</h3>

> Charles Piller, *Science*, 2026

This story is a tragic one at many levels, between the loss of trust in medicine, the patients that were not treated for their disease, the loss of millions of dollars, and most dramatic of all, the fact that this is not an isolated case. *Science* conducts an investigation of clinical trials in the Southern USA with some chilling constatation on the valdity of their results. Transparency over the "how" is as important if not more as it is to show string results. 

<h3>Some things do not need a control group</h3>

The Trump administration is retiring the [vaccination calendar](https://web.archive.org/web/20250218194648/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-schedules/child-easyread.html) for kids on the CDC under the justification that some of these (well-known, widely-used, genuinely life-saving) vaccines need to be tested with control group. I'd argue that when the result of a drug is that children live longer, we do not need a control group. Hey! let's stop giving insulin to diabetic patients to see if insulin really is good for them. Come on. Placebo vaccines will increase the mortality rate  dramatically.

<h2>Scientific literature</h2>
<h3>Particle Sweeping and Collection by Active and Living Filaments</h3>

      <p>The outreach paper I saw that was introducing this paper used the picture of a teenager cleaning their room as an introduction. Revolutionary system! Organize your room by swishing around wildly a large ribbon, the result may surprise you. The authors studied the impact on the organization of particles caused by the short range interactions resulting from the sweeping motion of a worm-like object, drawing an interesting relationship between active matter shaping its environment, which in return shapes its movement.</p>

<h3>Research on Rice Grain Collision Fracture Behavior With Experimental and Cohesive Zone Model</h3>

> Zhao et al., *Food Process Engineering*, 2026

I love it when science is an excuse to build a fun experiement, and a rice grain accelerator to study crack propagation and link it to the starches in different types of rice sure is fun. Beside the silliness at first, knowing the crack resistance of rices may lead to better processing and conservation in the future.
