Our group is welcoming [Vivek Singh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=kOqLdRMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) for a one year postdoc today! Vivek is an expert on homogeneization and finite element modelling, I'm really excited to see what new insights we can gain thanks to him.

On top of that, I am applying to a grant to hopefully supervize a PhD student next year, so the last few weeks have been busy and it is a bit difficult to free enough brainspace to focus on reading.

      <p>Marc Barthelemy proposes a new framework to study the growth of networks, from a centerpoint considering the energy distribution in lines growing from this center with a decreasing connectedness, as opposed to node-based networks. this new approach allows to model networks such as vascularization or public transport networks. At high distance from the center, the line growth is not fixed to a straight line and becomes angle-independednt.</p>
