December has started! i wish it had brought some actual cold but the temperatures are really mild still. Because my RSS feeds also give me some stuff from scientific news which are not really papers in the DOI/introduction/materials and methods/results/discussion/conclusion sense I have decided to subdivide again my little plan.

<h2>In the news</h2>
<h3>Mathematics is hard for mathematicians to understand too</h3>

There has been discussions between some scientists in every field on how to make our work more accessible and who we are doing sciences for, and this is another important insight into the door we are trying to open.

<h3>Major AI conference flooded with peer reviews written fully by AI</h3>

This is a classic story now. Someone for any reason decides to use an LLM to reduce their workload, and as a consequence increases the workload of everyone else. In terms of trustworthiness of scientific results, journals, and conferences, this **really** sucks. It is however, just aother symptom, along with the peer-review crisis, of the current economic system around research and its strain on findings.

<h3>‘Anti-woke’ policies blamed for falling attendance at some US conferences</h3>

The Trump policies on science hardcore suck, and the readiness with which most major USAmerican agencies complied also sucks. I wish I could do more that meagrely voice my support to overseas colleagues whose work and livelihood are impacted by reactionary measures. And this is not even mentioning [the terror that ICE is](https://xkcd.com/3081/), that most of my European colleagues are not even aware of.

<h3>‘They don’t have symptoms’: CAR-T therapies send autoimmune diseases into remission</h3>

CAR-T-cell therapy is widely used to treat cancers, and some really exciting studies show that they can also get auto-immune disease patients into remission.

<h3>Anomalous fracture behavior in borosilicate glass facilitated by stress-induced molecular rearrangements</h3>

Silica glasses tend to be extremely brittle, with an effective toughness usually orders of magnitude smaller than the theoretical toughness of over 12 GPa. Diverse methods have been developped to toughne glass on one hand, and to observe its high strain rate response on the other hand. Here the authors observe an anomalous toughening of their sample under a laser interferometry experiment. Additionnal Raman testing showed a molecular reorganization around the high strain zone, with rings of different microstructures.

<h3>Acoustic printing of conductive polymers</h3>

You know how when working with gels and elastomer, there are extremely strong constraints to different solidificatoin methods if you want to give them a very specific shape? Temperature catalyzation means you have to go fast and make sure nothing is overheating, and UV-catalyzation means you have to have a special lighting and a transparent material. Here the authors have developed a gel ink that cures under ultrasounds, allowing for local, potentially in-vivo, 3D-printing, with a spatial resolution of about 300 µm. Of course there are some constraints, but this method allowed the authros to actually print within biological tissues with no temperature inccrease, which I find extremely exciting.

      <p>Following <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/163459">the brilliant PhD thesis of Chase Hartquist</a>, I was really hoping someone would publish like this! This is a massive (64 pages!) review focused on the fracture resistance of polymer-like materials.</p>
