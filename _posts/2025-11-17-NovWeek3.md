As I open my emails and RSS feeds this morning, it would seem that Soft Matter is somewhat down --a shame, on top of the paper which got published last Wednesday, I had the immense opportnity to design the artwork for the backcover!

<h1>In the literature last week</h1>

Not much in terms of research caught my eyes this week, that happens. Last Friday I did get to attend the [Journée Systèmes et Matière Complexes](https://8jsmc2025.sciencesconf.org/) which quenched my thirst for learning what other scientists are doing around. There are still a couple of pieces (depressing ones, really) that I want to focus on.

<h2>U.S. Congress considers sweeping ban on Chinese collaborations</h2>

Under the justification of limiting foreign espionage, the US government is issuing an indiscriminate crackdown on their researchers working with Chinese (and Russian, Iranian, and North Korean) colleagues by proposing a bill to cut funds. Back in October, Stanford University published an [open letter](https://www.aasforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Request-from-Stanford-faculty-to-strike-SAFE-Research-ACT-from-NDAA-29-Oct-2025.pdf) opposing this bill.

<h2>Mortality impacts of rainfall and sea-level rise in a developing megacity </h2>

      <p>Study on the population of Mumbai show one cause of global-warming-linked surmortality, which is heavy rainfall and flooding. Demographic studies show that excess deaths happen in every social classes, but they are much heavier in slum populations and extreme among young children. Floods are one cause of death, but following heavy rainfalls, more people get sick and the incidence of deadly diseases (respiratory, but also intestinal and even cardiac illnesses) increases enough that even moderate rainfalls are linked to a dramatic increase in excess deaths. Timescale longer than five weeks are hard to evaluate, leading, among other factors, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03669-2">to an under-estimation of these surmortality rates</a>.</p>

<h2>Musings and questions</h2>
In the very unlikely chance that someone has actually decided to read that blog, I am repeating the question I asked myself [over on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/notinvampdiariz.bsky.social): should I add a sidebar with the researchers I regukarky check on in? During my teens, I would follow artblogs that had these sidebars with all the people they were friends with and whose work they liked, which would allow to find more blogs with related interests and interesting styles. I feel like this would be a fun little way to create a network of scientists with interesting work for the occasionnal student or newcomer to my research fields to immediately have a snapshot of recent research of interest. Similar to a "citing/publishing with" list you could find on Google Scholar, but with intent and personality!

In any case if I decide to try that out, it will take me a moment to wrangle the code of the theme in order to implement that.
