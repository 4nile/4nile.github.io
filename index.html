title: Welcome to my blog!

Hello world! This blog, once I figure out how to make it look and work the way I want, will be a repository where I will sum up the papers I try to read weekly. This will be a convenient tool to make sure I do remember what I read, as well as a conversation starter with colleagues. Cheers!
